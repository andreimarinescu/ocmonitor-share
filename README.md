## ⚙️ Configuration

### Configuration File Location

Create your configuration file at: **`~/.config/ocmonitor/config.toml`**

```bash
# Create the configuration directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/ocmonitor

# Create your configuration file
touch ~/.config/ocmonitor/config.toml
```

### Configuration Options

The tool is highly configurable through the `config.toml` file:

```toml
[paths]
messages_dir = "~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message"
export_dir = "./exports"

[ui]
table_style = "rich"
progress_bars = true
colors = true

[export]
default_format = "csv"
include_metadata = true
```

**Configuration File Search Order:**
1. `~/.config/ocmonitor/config.toml` (recommended user location)
2. `config.toml` (current directory)
3. Project directory fallback
